# PokeApi
<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Georgi Rabotov and this is the PokeApi</h1>
<h3 align="center">This is a PokeApi that was created for an interview with TrueLayer. </h3>
<h3 align="center">It was quite fun and challenging project to work on, obviously, it's an interview, so I had to show some of knowledge too! </h3>

<h2 align="center">How to run:</h2>
<br> Well... If you have Visual Studio installed, in the folder there is a .sln file, which would allow you to open the project. Otherwise, you might need to install Visual Studio.
<br> Once you are able to open the solution, you'll need to setup PokeApi.API as a StartUp Project, then all you'll need is to Start the application.
<br> Since this is a web API, you would need to start it with a browser, you could use any of your choice, for example, I am using Google Chrome. You could use it too if you have it installed, an alternative is Microsoft Edge (in case you're using Windows), or any other browser of your choice. That way  you can use swagger to test, otherwise you can actually hit the endpoint using postman as per your requirements (http://localhost:5000, or https://localhost:7013)

<h2 align="center">In case there is something that you think I should improve in code. Please leave a comment and I will get it resolved right away, or will probably ask you why do you think I should do that.</h2>
<br> If you feel that there are any gaps or places that I could improve the code I've written, please feel free to leave a comment and I will do my best to improve it as soon as I can.
<br> What would I do if that was production environment? </br>
<br> I would have empty appsettings and they would be inserted via deployment CI/CD Pipeline. For example a way that I've also done it before is by using Azure Key Vault </br>
<br> If it's production environment, I would also probably pay for the fun API, so it doesn't trip when it comes to making so many requests, and make sure that I would productionalize it. </br>
